After clonning the repository, make sure to install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#install),
and register the configured steps as you git pre commit hook:

```
pre-commit install
```

To ensure, you're on the same page as the CI flow, you can run `make` or `make test` before committing or pushing your changes.

Ensure that all the added code are tested and documented clearly.
